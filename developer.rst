Ignoring common functions on the stack
--------------------------------------

To improve clustering of similar crashes done at
:ref:`faf`, backtraces are first normalized to skip
common functions like ``_start`` from glibc or
``__kernel_vsyscall`` from Linux kernel.

Such functions are listed in
`satyr/lib/normalize.c <https://github.com/abrt/satyr/blob/master/lib/normalize.c>`_ file.
